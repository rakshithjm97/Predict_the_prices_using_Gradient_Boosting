# Predict_the_prices_using_Gradient_Boosting
In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model for estimating house prices in Boston using the XGBoost algorithm. We will utilize the well-known Boston Housing Data, which includes various features related to housing and socioeconomic factors, along with the median value of owner-occupied homes as the target variable.
